* MariaDB version 10 or later
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate is required. 

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Payment Page, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Payment Page" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

Then, you‚Äôll be the Add new form screen to select a form and connect payment gateways.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. WordPress documentation contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation-1/).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use Payment Page? =

Once you've activated the Payment Page plugin, you can select a Payment Page template based on your business needs. Customize the template as you choose, and you'll be accepting payments in minutes. 

= What is the best WordPress payment plugin? =

There are many plugins available to receive payments on your WordPress site. We built Payment Page to be as simple as possible to set up and accept payments as quickly as possible. It only takes 60 seconds to start accepting payments with Payment Page if you already have a Stripe account set up. For PayPal, only 2-3 minutes. 

We streamlined the entire process of creating flexible payment options for your customers with different currencies, payment frequencies, and intelligent filters that only display the relevant plans for customers to select.

We prioritized having a wide variety of payment options because many other solutions only support one gateway and a limited number of options. Flexibility is key in a world where we have so many digital wallets, customers potentially around the world, and consumer preferences demand streamlined payment flows. 

Because of some of these core tools, we believe Payment Page stands apart from the crowd. 

= What Payment Gateways are supported? =

Stripe and PayPal are currently both supported.

= Are recurring subscription payments supported? =

Yes. The free version supports recurring subscription payments for Stripe. 

= Are one-time payments supported? =

Yes. The free version of the plugin supports one-time payments for an unlimited number of pricing plans. 

= What kind of pricing options can I offer my customers? =

You can offer any plan you want! Payment Page is completely customizable and flexible for any kind of pricing plan you want to build, and if it‚Äôs not supported yet, just let us know and we‚Äôll do what we can to add it. 

You can accept recurring subscription payments and one-time payments in any currency supported by your payment gateway. You can also let customers enter their own invoice or donation amounts for total control. They‚Äôll even be able to choose to make it a recurring payment if they want to. 

= Can I receive custom payment amounts for invoices or other one-off payments? =

Yes. In the Free Plan, a custom amount field is automatically displayed when any of your pricing plans don‚Äôt have a price entered into them. This allows the customer to enter the amount they want to pay on the frontend of the form. 

Read about Custom Payment Amounts in our [Documentation](https://docs.payment.page/pricing-options/custom-payment-amounts).

= Are custom form fields supported? =

Absolutely. You can add custom form fields in the free version. The data in these fields will get stored in the Stripe metadata for that payment. 

= Can I prefill form fields automatically? =

Yes. In the free version, you can utilize Query String Parameters to automatically prefill all of your form fields, including custom fields. Query strings that match your custom fields‚Äô labels will be matched to those fields. Unmatched query strings will be passed to HTTP Requests as well as Stripe metadata fields. 

Read more about pre-filling form fields in our [Documentation](https://docs.payment.page/features/prefill-form-fields-query-strings).  

= What page builders are supported? =

= How can I make feature requests or see your product development roadmap? =

Vote for new features or make requests on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.payment.page/).

= Can I create automations based on payments? = 

Yes. We‚Äôve included the ability to send HTTP Requests including all form fields (except sensitive payment details), as well as query string parameters that are submitted on the page.

By connecting this HTTP Request to an external URL endpoint - either one you code and build yourself or a service like Zapier - you can automate any process you want. 

Currently, HTTP requests are only supported for Stripe payment methods, as the verification flow for PayPal is more complex. Contact us if you need the PayPal HTTP Requests to be enabled. 

= Does Payment Page charge any additional fees on my payments through Stripe or PayPal? =

The Free version of Payment Page charges a small 2% fee on Stripe payments, and no fees on PayPal payments. The purpose of this fee is to help us continue providing great features and updates for the plugin to the community. 

To remove the fee and get access to tons of other great features, like recurring subscription payments, automations, and more, please see our [upgrade options](https://payment.page/pricing/). 

= Where can I get support or submit bug reports? =
